Having a tracker on the student portal will help us take a quick glance and will help a lot more students to keep track of what's coming next
In addition a notification to remind to submit an assignmnet two days in advance will be even more helpful because most of us have a job alongside and sometimes we lose track of submissions
Planned on the project to be an extension of our ems website and how we can improve it to make it more interactive
Deciding on what features need to go in there and what will be a good way to keep track out activities
Plan on how to execute, but that will come togetehr with the code that we are going to write for it and deploy
Hopefully we can finish everything and present on the final day. This is an exciting project fro us to work on
